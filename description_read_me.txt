%% DESCRIPTION %%

This package is a prime numbers set exploration toolbox.

To use the sources and make it work, please mind to add its path to your paths. To do this, just execute addpath(genpath('my_path_to_the_sources')); command in Matlab console,
where 'my_path_to_the_sources' is the path to PNSET/src on your computer.


%% USE %%

To use the sources, mind to add its path to your paths, just like in the header of any test file : addpath(genpath('my_path_to_the_sources'));


%% HELP %%

A basic help is included in the header of each source file. It especially includes the function role and its input and output arguments precise descriptions (role, class, size, etc).
Just like for any Matlab (R) function, typewrite "help my_mesh_processing_file" in Matlab console to access it.


%% COPYRIGHT, LICENSE AND TERMS OF USE %%

Please read and refer to the attached file : Copyright_license_&_terms_of_use.txt


%% CURRENT KNOWN LIMITATIONS %%

Very large numbers.


%% MISC INFORMATION %%

Most of the time, I did my best to make function names pretty explicit in english.

Some functions (algodbach, frequency_of _prime_gap, isprime_optimus) are also independently available with their documentations in my file exchange contributions.

Matlab users, your advices and tips to improve and speed up my algorithms are welcomeÂ !

Since I am not native english speaker, please forgive my langage approximations.

Matlab release version used for development and tests : R2019b.

Contact : please report me any bug (with data set used and Matlab(R) code attached) or suggestion at nicolas.douillet9 (at) gmail.com

Please don't forget to rate this toolbox if it helped you. Thanks ! ;-)
